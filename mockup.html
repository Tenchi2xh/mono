                          This a bold claim, but I stand behind it: if you learn and follow             ④   ʟɪɴᴇ ʟᴇɴɢᴛʜ is the horizontal width of the text block. Line length

                              text look good. Then worry about the rest.                                That’s it. As you put these five rules to work, you’ll notice your                 <span style="font-weight:bold;">In conclusion</span>
