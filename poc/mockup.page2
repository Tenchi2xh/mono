        ④   ʟɪɴᴇ ʟᴇɴɢᴛʜ is the horizontal width of the text block. Line length
            should be an average of [1m45–90 characters[22m per line (use your word-
            count function) or [1m2–3 lowercase alphabets[22m, like so:

            abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcddefghijklm

            In a printed document, this usually means  ᴘᴀɢᴇ ᴍᴀʀɢɪɴꜱ larger than
            one inch (a ᴛʏᴘᴇᴡʀɪᴛᴇʀ ʜᴀʙɪᴛ). On a web page, it usually means pre-
            venting the text from flowing to the edges of the browser window.

        ⑤   And finally⁴, font choice. The fastest, easiest, and most visible         [2m⁴: Another side-[22m
            improvement you can make to your typography is to ignore the fonts          [2mnote. Exciting![22m
            already loaded on your computer (known as ꜱʏꜱᴛᴇᴍ ꜰᴏɴᴛꜱ) and the
            ꜰʀᴇᴇ ꜰᴏɴᴛꜱ that inundate the internet. Instead, buy a professional
            font (like those found in ꜰᴏɴᴛ ʀᴇᴄᴏᴍᴍᴇɴᴅᴀᴛɪᴏɴꜱ). A professional
            font gives you the benefit of a professional designer’s skills
            without having to hire one.

            If that’s impossible, you can still make good typography with sys-
            tem fonts. But choose wisely. And never choose ᴛɪᴍᴇꜱ ɴᴇᴡ ʀᴏᴍᴀɴ or
            ᴀʀɪᴀʟ, as those fonts are favored only by the apathetic and sloppy.
            Not by typographers. Not by you.
