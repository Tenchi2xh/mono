                        This a bold claim, but I stand behind it: if you learn and follow
                        these five typography rules, you will be a better typographer than
                        nearly every writer—and even most graphic designers.

                        All it takes is ten minutes: five minutes to read these rules once.
                        Then five minutes to read them again.

                        ①   The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by
       [3mIt looks cool[23m        how the  ʙᴏᴅʏ  text looks. Why? Because there’s more body text
                            than anything else. So start every project by making the body
                            text look good. Then worry about the rest.

                            In turn, the appearance of the body text is determined primarily
                            by these four typographic choices:

                        ②   ᴘᴏɪɴᴛ ꜱɪᴢᴇ is the how big the font is. In print, the most comfor-
  [2m³: This is a foot-[22m        table range for body text is [1m10–12 point[22m, or [1m15–25 pixels[22m³.
    [2mnote. Well, more[22m
    [2mlike a [3mside-note[23m[22m        Not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so be
                            prepared to adjust as needed.

                        ③   ʟɪɴᴇ ꜱᴘᴀᴄɪɴɢ is the vertical distance between lines. It should be
                            [1m120–145%[22m of the point size. In word processors, use the “Exact”
                            line-spacing option to achieve this. The default single-line op-
                            tion is too tight; the 1½-line option is too loose. In CSS, use
                            the 𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚎-𝚑𝚎𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 property (preferably with a unitless value,
                            so 130% would become 1.3).
